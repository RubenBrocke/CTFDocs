## Explaination

Where the previously mentioned ROT cipher moves all letters by the same ammount the vigenere cipher improves on this by using a key indicating by what ammount the given character in the plaintext needs to be shifted to get to the correct ciphertext character. A usefull feature this cipher has is the ability to transform different plaintext characters into the same ciphertext character (something I mentioned on the [ROT ciper](./doccrypto1) page)

## Example

Plaintext: `There is an army marching in the east`

After putting this through viginere with the key:`Hailtheking` we get:

Ciphertext: `Ahmcx pw kv nxty ulkjlsvt ou tpp xhwd`

## Detecting

Just like the ROT cipher it can be hard to detect if this specific cipher is being used

## Solving
